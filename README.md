# code_2015_analysis

We used 2 classes to perform the empiricala analysis of our code. 

Namely, 

A class that performed entry generation to test our code by filling in random data in file. A number is passed as argument 
representing number of entry to be tested. We used it with a max of 50000 to test our code.

A class where duration of code execution and number of entries are passed as parameter and a graph is sketched. 
JFreeChart has been used for that.

Here is an example of output produced:
